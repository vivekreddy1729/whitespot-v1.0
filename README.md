MySql Database used while developing the application but, later moved on to the Sqlite3 and there is not no need of configuring anything. The application is lite and easy to run on any local machine or webserver without configuring anything.

Phpmailer works only on a webserver so, the email confirmation functionality does not work on local machine.
